# Inventory Turnover Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes **inventory turnover** to help operations teams plan efficient restocking. Inventory turnover shows how quickly inventory is sold and replaced over time.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- MS Excel

---

## 📂 Dataset
Monthly CSV data containing:
- Opening Inventory
- Closing Inventory
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Month

---

## 📊 Inventory Turnover Formula
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory  

Average Inventory = (Opening Inventory + Closing Inventory) / 2

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Process

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
CSV data is loaded into Python using pandas and also imported into MS Excel for analysis.

### 2️⃣ Data Processing (Python – Pandas)
- Calculate Average Inventory
- Compute Inventory Turnover for each month
- Prepare clean monthly data for visualization

### 3️⃣ Visualization (Matplotlib)
- Create a 12-month line chart
- X-axis: Month
- Y-axis: Inventory Turnover Ratio
- Export chart as PNG

### 4️⃣ Excel Dashboard
- Load processed data into Excel
- Create a line chart
- Enable interactivity using tables and slicers

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- Excel workbook with interactive chart
- Python script & Jupyter notebooks
- PNG image of turnover visualization

---

## 🎯 Outcome
The visualization helps identify fast- and slow-moving inventory periods, improving restocking and inventory planning decisions.
